# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

> Predicting real estate prices using Supervised Machine Learning

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **Linear Regression model** to predict residential house prices using historical property data.

The goal is to automate the pricing process for a real estate company by leveraging machine learning techniques. The model learns patterns from features such as property size, zoning classification, building type, basement area, construction year, and overall condition to estimate market value accurately.

## 🎯 Business Problem

A real estate company handles thousands of property transactions annually. Manual price estimation can be time-consuming and inconsistent.

This project aims to:
- Automate house price prediction
- Improve pricing accuracy
- Support data-driven decision-making

## 📊 Dataset Description

Each row in the dataset represents one residential property.

### Key Features:
- **MSSubClass** – Type of dwelling
- **MSZoning** – Zoning classification
- **LotArea** – Lot size in square feet
- **LotConfig** – Lot configuration
- **BldgType** – Type of building
- **OverallCond** – Overall condition rating (1–10)
- **YearBuilt** – Original construction year
- **YearRemodAdd** – Year of remodeling
- **Exterior1st** – Exterior covering
- **BsmtFinSF2** – Finished basement area
- **TotalBsmtSF** – Total basement area
- **SalePrice** – Target variable (House Price)
